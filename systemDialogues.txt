-TUTORIAL
It is the year 3042 and the russians launched a full scale nuclear attack in the world and all life ceased to exist. Except you.
You were ice fishing and then your high school bully pushed you into the fishing hole and you froze into cryogenic state.
When you woke up all you have is yourself and various mutated enemies. These enemies seemed to have adapated and carry around bag of items.
Some may be dangerous and some may be weak. Lucky for you there are safespots around you that allow you to heal and upgrade yourself.
Navigate around the world and survive as long as you can while hunting enemies for food and water. Goodluck.
